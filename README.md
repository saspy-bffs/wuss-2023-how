# Everything is Better with Friends: Using SAS in Python Applications with SASPy and Open-Source Tooling (Getting Started)


### Materials from a Hands-on Workshop at [Western Users of SAS Software (WUSS)](https://www.wuss.org/) in San Diego, California, on 31OCT2023.

Materials provided:

  - [Examples and Exercises](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hJRTGOAKKSbE9746mms8HTdrNAfV3SMG#offline=true&sandboxMode=true) as an interactive Google Colab Notebook

  - [Solutions to all Exercises](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1h3YjueG9YZfh5QIl0w2k3Rab5A59NVhd#offline=true&sandboxMode=true) as an interactive Google Colab Notebook

  - [Solutions to all Exercises](solutions/Solutions-Everything_is_Better_with_Friends-Getting_Started.pdf) as a PDF file

  - [Slides](slides/Slides-Everything_Is_Better_With_Friends-WUSS2023.pdf) as a PDF file    


## Setup Instructions & Prerequisites

### Accounts Needed

In order to interact with code examples, accounts for the following two online services will be needed:

- Google
  - We'll be using Google accounts to run code examples in [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
  - If you don't already have a Google Account, you can create one for free at [https://accounts.google.com/signup](https://accounts.google.com/signup) 

- SAS OnDemand for Academics (ODA)
  - We'll be accessing ODA accounts from Google Colab, which will require you to know the Region associated with your ODA account. (The Region for an ODA account is typically displayed in the upper-right corner after logging in.)
  - If you don't already have an ODA account, you can create one for free at [https://welcome.oda.sas.com/](https://welcome.oda.sas.com/)
  - Note: To create an ODA account, you will also need a SAS Profile account. If you don't already have a SAS Profile account, you can create one for free using the "Don't have a SAS Profile?" link on the ODA login page.

To test your setup, please follow the instructions in our [Setup Test Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qtnXrOmAYAlulrtUPrnJ-7KfVGXEmcws#offline=true&sandboxMode=true). If desired, you can use the __File__ -> __Save a Copy in Drive__ command to save a copy of the results.

All in-class examples assume the use of Google Colab and ODA, and we will not be able to provide support for any other setup. However, if you're interested in using a local SASPy environment, with Python talking to a commercial SAS installation, you're welcome to follow the setup instructions for the demo application [https://github.com/saspy-bffs/dataset-explorer](https://github.com/saspy-bffs/dataset-explorer)


### Attendee Prerequisites

This Hands-on Workshop is aimed at SAS programmers of all skill levels, including those with no prior experience using Python or JupyterLab. However, some examples do use the SAS Macro Facility.

We also recommend a relatively new computer with a broadband internet connection and a modern web browser.


## Learning Outcomes

After successfully completing this class, we will be equipped for the following:

-	Using Google Colab for Python script development, including linking to SAS OnDemand for Academics to access the SAS analytical engine
-	Using SAS and Python together with SASPy, include understanding the trade-offs of completing common data-science tasks in SAS and Python.
-	Exchanging data between Python and SAS sessions.
-	Using Python to imitate the SAS Macro Facility.
